#Snag Browser
##Shortcuts:
1) ctrl-q = quit

2) f11 = Full Screen

##Description:

A browser focused on eliminating distractions and reducing the data used in every-day browsing. 

This browser is built off of QT's Webkit, which takes a lot of work off the hands of the programmer, and it can give you the web as you are used to. We of course took that and tweaked it a bit. Images, javascript, and Video plugins are disabled by default. At the bottom of the browser you will see a little pop-button that will bring up those options.

If all three are enabled (you've selected all three) then you will have a normal browser on your hands, it will use as much data as any other. With all three disabled, you might find that you'll be using about 1/10th to 1/30th of your average data.

This is a work-in-progress of course. Next to be implemented is a back/foreward/refresh button set, but that's been on my mind since I started this project. For now, right-click on white area and it will give those options.
