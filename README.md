#Snag Browser
##Build: 
Either use qtcreator5 on the SnagBrowser.pro file, or use $make in the command line.
Then move the newly created executable into your local bin or run from the folder you built it in.

##Shortcuts:
1) ctrl-q = quit
2) f11 = Full Screen
3) ctrl-b = go back
4) ctrl-LeftArrow = go back
5) ctrl-RightArrow = go forward

##Description:

A browser focused on eliminating distractions and reducing the data used in every-day browsing. 

By default, images, javascript, and video streaming are all turned off every time you restart the browser. At the bottom of the browser is a small pop-button, hit it to access the options to turn these three back on.

If all three are enabled (you've selected all three) then you will have a normal browser on your hands, it will use as much data as any other. With all three disabled, you might find that you'll be using about 1/10th to 1/30th of your average data.

This is a work-in-progress of course. Next to be implemented is a back/foreward/refresh button set, but that's been on my mind since I started this project. For now, right-click on white area and it will give those options or use the shortcuts as listed above.
