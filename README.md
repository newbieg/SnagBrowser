# Snag Browser

## Shortcuts:
1. ctrl-q = quit
2. f11 = Full Screen
3. ctrl-b = go back
4. ctrl-LeftArrow = go back
5. ctrl-RightArrow = go forward

## Description:

A browser focused on eliminating distractions and reducing the data used in every-day browsing. 

By default, images, javascript, and video streaming are all turned off every time you restart the browser. At the bottom of the browser is a small pop-button, hit it to access the options to turn these three back on.

If all three are enabled (you've selected all three) then you will have a normal browser on your hands, it will use as much data as any other. With all three disabled, you might find that you'll be using about 1/10th to 1/30th of your average data or better.



## Build: 
Either use qtcreator5 on the SnagBrowser.pro file, or use $make in the command line.
Then move the newly created executable into your local bin or run from the folder you built it in.

## Up and Comming:
* Back/foreward/refresh button sets near the address bar.
* Webcrawl-To-PDF-feature. Turn this on and a PDF will begin to emerge of your internet adventures. Every page that loads will be added to this pdf... That's why I named it the SnagBrowser; Idealy you are snagging the data so you can return to it without further use of your precious data.
* Eventually I want the previous option to output in a searchable manner, which pdf's aren't all that efficient in doing sometimes.
